Apollo is one of the most popular GraphQL libraries available today. In this episode, Khalil Stemmler teaches us how to get started with Apollo Client's latest major release.

This is a tutorial app to learn Apollo Client during Jason Lengstorf's livestream @ "[Let's Learn Apollo Client v3! (with Khalil Stemmler)](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/let-s-learn-apollo-client-v3)".

> For more examples on how to do Local State, Remote State, utilize the new AC3 cache APIs, check out the [@apollo/ac3-state-management-examples](https://github.com/apollographql/ac3-state-management-examples) repo.
